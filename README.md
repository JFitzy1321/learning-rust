# "Learning Rust" Tutorial Repository

Mono repo for rust tutorials and practice code. 

Tracking my time through "The Rust Book" and the "Rust By Example Book" via issues. Each chapter will have it's own "issue" to track progress.

This is not a usable crate, library, or binaries. Do not expect working builds.

Clone at your own risk!
